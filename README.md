# 👋 Hi there, I'm Joep!

Powered by curiosity, coffee, and a bit too much time behind the keyboard.
I enjoy turning ideas into code and building things that (hopefully) make sense.

- Turn ideas into clean, working code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
- Solve problems one bug at a time.
- Learn new tools and tricks constantly.
- Build things that people find useful (and maybe even fun!).
